MNIST dataset is a benchmark dataset which was originally used to recognize handwritten numbers. MNIST has 10 classes, including grey scale (in this case) images of handwritten integers from 0 to 9. So, the task can be seen as a computer vision application when the aim is to detect images correctly as what the integer is on the given image.

The model is depicted above, as we see it is simple as it could be with one dense layer.

From the figure showing the confusion matrix, we can make a conclusion that how the model did on classification task where there are 10 categories of numbers when the images of handwritten numbers were used to train the model.

The loss and accuracy plots suggest that the model on MNIST dataset is suitable in a way that good accuracy score is achieved by the model.
