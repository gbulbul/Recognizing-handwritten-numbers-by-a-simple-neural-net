The model is depicted above, as we see it is simple as it could be with one dense layer.

MNIST has 10 classes, including grey scale (in this case) images of integers from 0 to 9. So, the task can be seen as a computer vision application when the aim is to detect images correctly as what the integer is on the given image. Furthermore, MNIST dataset is a benchmark dataset which was originally used to recognize handwritten numbers.
